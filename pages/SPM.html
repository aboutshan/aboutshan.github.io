												<p style="color:black"> Quasiparticle interference (QPI) has been an extremely important technique 
												widely applied to elucidate the electron pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors. </p>
												<p style="color:black"> Impurity scattering of quasiparticles generates interference patterns, which can be seen 
												as the corrugations in a typical differential conductance mapping. It should be noted that 
												the number of scattering centers need not be very small in order to yield high signal-to-noise 
												ratio, nor be very big so that the electronic structure is not significantly affected. 
												After Fourier transformation, more detailed information about the momentum transfer between two states can be revealed.</p>
                                                <p style="color:black">For such an analyzing technique, one needs to perform Fourier transformation to the conductance 
												mapping and yields the power spectrum. But when it comes to reality, further treatments are needed 
												in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the quality of the image.</p>

                                                <p style="color:black">Firstly, we correct local distortions due to thermal drift and piezoelectric hysteresis by making 
												use of the simultaneously derived real-space topography data, based on Lawler-Fujita algorithm
												(引用文献2010 nature). Secondly, after Fourier transformation of the mapping, a spatial filtering 
												is needed to suppress the high signal near the center. Lastly, all FFT images are four-fold symmetrized 
												to further reduce the noise, according to the C4 symmetry of FeSe crystal structure.

                                                <p style="color:black">Upon application of Lawler-Fujita algorithm, the Bragg peaks, along with other peaks associated with 
												modulation commensurate with the lattice, collapse to a single pixel with enhanced brightness, whereas 
												other peaks related to environmental noise broaden. Therefore, we can differentiate between intrinsic 
												characteristics of the sample and external noise.</p>

												<p style="color:black"> Using magnetic tips, we are able to observe spin-polarized tunnelling
                                                current, which provides an access to unveiling exotic electron states, spin-stucture, and so on.
 												So, Spin-Polarized STM (SP-STM) is an invaluable extension to converntional STM techniques. </p>
