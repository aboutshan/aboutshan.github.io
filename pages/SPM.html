												<p> Quasiparticle interference (QPI) has been an extremely important technique 
												widely applied to elucidate the electron pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors. 
												Impurity scattering of quasiparticles generates interference patterns, which can be seen 
												as the corrugations in a typical differential conductance mapping. It should be noted that 
												the number of scattering centers need not be very small in order to yield high signal-to-noise 
												ratio, nor be very big so that the electronic structure is not significantly affected. 
												After Fourier transformation, more detailed information about the momentum transfer between two states can be revealed.
For such an analyzing technique, one needs to perform Fourier transformation to the conductance mapping and yields the power spectrum. But when it comes to reality, further treatments are needed in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and improve the quality of the image.

Firstly, we correct local distortions due to thermal drift and piezoelectric hysteresis by making use of the simultaneously derived real-space topography data, based on Lawler-Fujita algorithm(引用文献2010 nature). Secondly, after Fourier transformation of the mapping, a spatial filtering is needed to suppress the high signal near the center. Lastly, all FFT images are four-fold symmetrized to further reduce the noise, according to the C4 symmetry of FeSe crystal structure.

Upon application of Lawler-Fujita algorithm, the Bragg peaks, along with other peaks associated with modulation commensurate with the lattice, collapse to a single pixel with enhanced brightness, whereas other peaks related to environmental noise broaden. Therefore, we can differentiate between intrinsic characteristics of the sample and external noise.(从这里开始引？？)

Later on, a new algorithm that performs unit-cell averaging and allows sub-unit-cell resolution was proposed. I will refer to it as MAUC (make average unit cell). The core of MAUC is to make use of many unit cells in a large FOV, average, and build up a weighted histogram at each sub-unit-cell position in the average unit cell. The method can be easily extended to be applied to a ‘supercell’ of any size.
It should be pointed out that since MAUC is based on drift-corrected data, choice of parameters in the drift-correction process might influence the average unit cell result. Actually, a detailed, systematic study has been carried out in ref.(phd thesis). Care should be taken whenever we do background subtraction, choose the length scale over which to extract the local drift, remove bad pixels, choose the Q vector to drift-correct raw data onto, and etc.
