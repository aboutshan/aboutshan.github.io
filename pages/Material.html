												<p> When scientists twist single atomic layers of suitable materials, such as graphene, 
												new properties emerge. It was shown in 2018 that as the twist angle between two graphene
												sheets is tuned to about 1°, the physical properties of the system change dramatically.</p>
												
												<h3 align="left">Our work (patent)
												</h4>
												<p>We devised an innovative methodology to synthesize twisted bilayer or few-layer graphene, 
												which has a non-trivial twisting angle between layers, based on chemical vapor deposition (CVD).</p> 
												<p>Traditionally when we implement CVD to grow graphene, due to interlayer coupling effect, the 
												newly formed layer tends to remain aligned with the previous one, forming a typical AB stacking order. 
												A lack in the diversity of the twist angle impedes further exploration of the physics behind.</p>
                                                <p>With the aim to reduce such effect, we introduced perturbation during the growing process, 
												successfully leading the seeds of the second layer graphene to deviate from that of the 
												first layer. We established that multiple kinds of changes in the growing conditions 
												can act as the perturbation. The non-trivial twist angle was verified by later characterization. 
												Furthermore, it is easy to extend this method to grow few-layer graphene by introducing just 
												another perturbation at a proper time.</p>

												<p>In our lab, the ultrahigh-vacuum MBE-STM combined system(Scienta Omicron) 
												enables us to make in situ measurements of the sample grown by molecular-beam epitaxy technique.</p>
                                                <p>One of the intensely studied systems is the one-unit-cell FeSe/SrTiO3(001), with or without Fe, Pb adatoms 
												or clusters. The Nb-doped SrTiO3(001) substrate was pretreated by the Se-flux method in MBE chamber. Then 
												the 1-UC FeSe film was grown by coevaporating high-purity Fe (99.994%) and Se (99.999%) from an e-beam 
												evaporator and a Knudsen cell, respectively, at a substrate temperature of 400 °C, followed by annealing 
												at 450 °C for hours. After the preparation of the 1-UC FeSe sample, we could deposit magnetic or nonmagnetic 
												atoms on the FeSe surface.</p>
												<p>Besides, by flash annealing in UHV, we can prepare large-scale bilayer graphene on 
												nominally flat 6H-SiC(0001) substrates.</p>

												<p>When it comes to evaluating the orientations of graphene domains, 
												several choices are available for experimentalists. Firstly we can analyze 
												the diffraction patterns at different spots, but this is indirect and 
												somewhat tedious. Besides, if the coverage is low, the directions of graphene 
												edges may be helpful, but this doesn’t work in a fully-covered case.</p>
                                                <p>We have developed a hole-etching technique to identify polycrystalline 
												graphene domains via convenient image-processing of optical microscopy photos.</p>
                                                <p>It can also come as a way to estimate the density of point defects for 
												the grown graphene.</p>
